Flynn Documentation Project


GOALS

Create an initial documentation of the Flynn product
Write some tutorial materials, getting started etc
Develop the basis for multilingual contributions from open source project participants
Deliver the documentation in sync with the initial Flynn release 


BACKGROUND

Flynn is an open source project that develops a Platform as a Service product. As many software developers embrace agile development methodologies and cloud deployment infrastructures, the opportunity to release functionality rapidly often creates resource bottlenecks between conventional IT and product development. Flynn is a product designed to remove the bottlenecks and automate the delivery.  Designed to simplify running many services at scale, Flynn supports numerous services including databases. Flynn supports product delivery and IT operations by simplifying deployment and application scaling.
